# Huffman Compression

## Description
The project is able to generate Huffman trees based on texts saved in txt files.
For more information about huffman encoding see:

For more detailed information about how to use classes and methods see project's documentation (in ./doc folder)

## Before running
Due to Github's file sizes limits, it wasn't possible to attach the texts. The trees used to decode books and their compressed versions are already saved in resources directory.
Main.java class contains code that decompreses those texts and saves them in "./resources/books". It has to be run once, to fetch the texts and use other functions.
Main.java contains examples of using different functions.
